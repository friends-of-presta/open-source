# Friends of Presta Code of Conduct

English Version

## Purpose

The purpose of this Code of Conduct is to outline the expectations for participating in the open-source project Friends of Presta (hereafter referred to as the "Project"), as well as the steps to report unacceptable behaviors or situations.

The Code of Conduct aims to create a positive, caring, and cooperative community for everyone, whether you are beginners or experts, whether you are asking questions or seeking to share your knowledge.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all individuals contributing to the Slack "Friends of Presta" and/or the GitHub organization "Friends of Presta," including online contributions, whether creating/updating repositories, posts, and/or tickets.

## Expected Behaviors

The Code of Conduct, aiming to create a positive and caring community, requires the following principles to be respected to foster constructive and respectful exchanges:

- If you wish to help others, be patient and kind. Participating in our community can be challenging, especially for new members. Encourage newcomers as they learn.
- If seeking help, make it easy for members to assist you. The success of our community is possible thanks to all its volunteers. Don't worry if other members or moderators edit and/or rephrase your question; they are trying to make it understandable and interesting for a broader audience.
- Be respectful, courteous, and polite. It is essential for community members to show respect, even in the presence of differing opinions. The community accepts and welcomes anyone, from any background and identity, interested in the Project and willing to contribute to its development.
- If someone points out that your behavior makes others uncomfortable, stop it. Sometimes we inadvertently say things that negatively affect others. Even if it was not your intention, apologize. When giving feedback, avoid sarcasm and jokes. Also, be open to receiving constructive feedback.
- It is required that all interactions within the community remain lawful. Only share content you own or have the right to share; do not share sensitive information, etc.
- Keep discussions with other community members within the Project framework. Except for cases where a module can solve an issue encountered in using the Prestashop solution or event sponsorship, spams or advertising messages are not welcome except in dedicated channels.

This list is not exhaustive. We expect this Code to be followed both in spirit and in letter.

## Prohibited Behaviors

Certain behaviors are considered unacceptable and violate this Code of Conduct. These include:

- Infringements on the rights of others, including the right to privacy, intellectual property rights (such as copyright, trademark rights, patents, etc.), trade secrets, personal violations, etc.
- Rudeness and mockery.
- Insults, discrimination, or personal attacks. This includes insults or offenses related to origins, nationality, political opinions, religion, sexual orientation, identity, age, culture, ethnicity, language, profession, belonging to a minority, physical or mental abilities.
- Harassment, especially moral or sexual.
- Verbal or physical violence, intimidation, threats, etc. This includes subtle "belittling" messages or unwelcoming language. Regardless of intent, this behavior can be negatively received by other members.

The Code of Conduct is not intended to exhaustively detail all forms of prohibited behavior, harassment, or violence, and it is not sought to rank said behaviors or consider some not worth sanctioning.

When a project member feels harassed or is in an uncomfortable situation, they are asked to report it in accordance with the procedure outlined below. This will then be examined.

## Reporting Abuse

If you believe that unacceptable behavior targets you or other community members, you can:

- Report it using the "report content" functions provided on the contributory sites.
- Explain directly to the person concerned how their behavior affects you or others.
- In the case of an online event, you can report abuse to a Slack administrator.

In the latter cases, the report must contain the following information:

- Your contact information so that you can be contacted. Anonymous reports cannot be processed.
- Your name and the names of the individuals involved.
- A description of what you think happened, and if you think the situation persists, do not forget to provide a link to the discussion or web page in question.
- Any additional information that may be helpful.

After reporting abuse, the most suitable person will take charge of the situation to verify it. This person may ask you additional questions if necessary, and together you can determine how to respond and manage the situation.

If the person bothering you is a moderator, they will be asked to recuse themselves. If the complaint comes from a moderator, another moderator will handle the complaint.

## Sanctions

Each situation will be handled on a case-by-case basis by the responsible individuals.

In case of non-compliance with the principles of this Code of Conduct, the following warning procedure may apply:

- Upon the first report, the moderator will send a warning, which may be public or private, to the person concerned, and the content in question may be removed or modified.
- Depending on the cases, the person's account may be temporarily suspended.
- For certain cases, such as extreme behavior disrupting the community, threats, violence, a ban from the community may be applied, along with a prohibition from participating in an event.

In case of participation in an event, an organizer will directly address the alleged author to explain the facts alleged against them and inform them of the actions that may be taken against them.

In case of repeated behavior, organizers reserve the right to exclude a participant.

If you have any doubts about how a moderator handled the situation, you can contact any member of the administration team by signaling yourself on Slack.

NB: Spam is not constructive and pollutes contributory sites. Such contributions are unwelcome, and associated accounts will be immediately banned.

The code of conduct is intended to apply equally to each member of the community; regardless of their commitment or role in the Project.
